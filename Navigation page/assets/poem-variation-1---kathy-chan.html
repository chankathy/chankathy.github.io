<p> <center> Six hours like this for a few francs. <br>
 <i> Belly nipple arse </i> in the window light, <br>
<strong> he drains the color from me.</strong>  Further to the right, <br>
Madame. And do try to be still. <br>
I shall be represented analytically and hung <br>
in great museums. The <big> <i> bourgeoisie </i> </big> will coo <br>
at such an image of a river-whore. They call it <i> Art. </i> <br> </p1>
<br>
Maybe. He is concerned with <i> volume, space </i>.  <br>
I with <strong> the next meal. </strong> You're getting thin, <br>
Madame, this is not good. My breasts hang <br>
slightly low, the studio is cold. In the tea-leaves <br>
I can see the <big> Queen of England</big> gazing <br>
on my shape. Magnificent, she murmurs, <br>
moving on. It makes me laugh. His name <br>
<br>
is Georges. They tell me he's a <i> genius.</i> <br>
There are times he does not concentrate <br>
and <u> stiffens for my warmth. </u> <br>
<br>
He <i> possesses </i> me on canvas as he dips the brush <br>
<big> <u>repeatedly</u></big> into the paint. <strong> Little man, <br>
you've not the money for the arts I sell. </strong> <br>
Both poor, we make our living how we can. <br>
<br>
I ask him Why do you do this? Because <br>
I have to. There's no choice. Don't talk.<br>
My smile <u> confuses</u> him. These artists <br>
take themselves too seriously. At night I fill myself <br>
with wine and dance around the bars. When it's finished <br>
he shows me proudly, lights a cigarette. I say <br>
Twelve francs and get my shawl. <br>
...... <br> 
<i> It does not look like me. </i> </center> </p>
